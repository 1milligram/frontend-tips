In the following example, you can see we get the type for param `a` and `b` as `any`. And, also the `return` type here is `any`.

We can add a comment before the function to define the type of the function params, and returning value. We can also write about what the function actually does.

This is a mini example of using JSDoc in your project. To know more about this, you can [check here](https://jsdoc.app/).
