According to the [HTML specifications](https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/dom.html#the-id-attribute), a valid `id` can consist of almost characters except [ASCII whitespace](https://infra.spec.whatwg.org/#ascii-whitespace).
Assume that we have an element representing an user's email address:

```html
<div id="user.email" />
```

In order to access the element, the `getElementById()` method accepts all of three ways passing the `id`:

```js
// They return the same element
document.getElementById('user.email');
document.getElementById('user\\.email');
document.getElementById('user\\\\.email');
```

But these methods return different results if you are using [jQuery](https://jquery.com) library:

```js
// Function				// Returned element
$('#user.email'); // <div id="user" class="email" />
$('#user\\.email'); // <div id="user" class="email" />
$('#user\\\\.email'); // <div id="user.email" />
```

As you see, the first two methods will find an element with `id` of `user` and has `email` class.
In order to get the correct element, we have to escape the `id` using double backslashes (`\\`). It also happens if we use the same value in CSS:

```css
#user.email {
    ...;
}
```

All the styles declared within `#user.email { ... }` has effect on the element with `id` of `user` and has the `email` class.

The styles aren't applied to element with `id` of `user.email`. To define the styles for our element, we have to escape the selector.
But this time, it requires a _single_ backslash only:

```css
#user\\.email {
    ...;
}
```

Avoid using the special characters in the `id` and `class` attributes will help us get rid of the confusion and errors above.
If it's not possible to get rid of colons and periods (for example, the `id` attribute is generated by the server side), then you can use the single backslash as above, or use the attribute selector.
Note that it has a lower specificity than the `id` selector:

```css
[id='user.email'] {
    ...;
}
```
