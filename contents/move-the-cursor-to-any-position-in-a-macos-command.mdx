title: Move the cursor to any position in a macOS command

We often use the arrow keys to move the cursor when editing the command line on the terminal.

Imagine that the target position is somewhere in the middle of the command text, pressing the arrow keys multiple times takes time and isn't a comfortable process.

Fortunately, there is a shortcut that makes the process easier - holding down the <kbd>alt</kbd> key while clicking the mouse at the desired position.
The following video demonstrates how to fix a typo in a command using this tip.
