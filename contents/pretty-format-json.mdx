title: Pretty format JSON

We often use `JSON.stringify` to generate JSON for a given object. By default, it removes all spaces between items. It's not easy to scan the output, especially when using with `console.log`.

Do you know that it's possible for us to generate a pretty output by passing the indentation level to the third parameter?

```js
const person = {
    firstName: 'John',
    lastName: 'Doe',
    ages: 42,
};

JSON.stringify(person, null, 2);

/*
"{
  "firstName": "John",
  "lastName": "Doe",
  "ages": 42
}"
*/
```

If you prefer tab for the indentations, then passing the `\t` character:

```js
JSON.stringify(person, null, '\t');

/*
"{
	"firstName": "John",
	"lastName": "Doe",
	"ages": 42
}"
*/
```
