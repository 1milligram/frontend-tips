title: Always put the footer at the bottom
---

Assume that our page is organized by three parts: the header, main content and footer. It's a common layout that the footer is always displayed at the bottom no matter how long the main content is.

```html
<body>
    <div class="container">
        <header>...</header>
        <main>...</main>
        <footer>...</footer>
    </div>
</body>
```

Using CSS flexbox, the layout can be implemented as following:

```css
.container {
    display: flex;
    flex-direction: column;
    min-height: 100vh;
}

header,
footer {
    flex-shrink: 0;
}

main {
    flex-grow: 1;
}
```

Setting `flex-grow: 1` to the main content will make it take the available spaces. The footer then [sticks at the bottom](https://phuoc.ng/collection/css-layout/sticky-footer/).
