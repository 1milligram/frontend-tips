If you want to count how many times a function has been called, you probably think of a global variable:

```js
let counter = 0;

const expensiveFunctionToDebug = () => {
    counter++;
    console.log(`This function has been called: ${counter}`);

    // Function body ...
};
```

We simply increase the counter by 1 and log the latest value whenever the `expensiveFunctionToDebug` function is invoked. `console`Â has a great method to do the same thing:

```js
const expensiveFunctionToDebug = () => {
    console.count('expensiveFunctionToDebug');

    // Function body ...
};
```

In the _Console_ tab of browsers, you will see something as following:

```shell
expensiveFunctionToDebug: 1
expensiveFunctionToDebug: 2
...
expensiveFunctionToDebug: 10
```

The `console.count` function prints the label you pass to it followed by the number of times the function is executed.
