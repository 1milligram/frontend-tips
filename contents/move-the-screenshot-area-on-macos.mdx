title: Move the screenshot area on macOS
---

On macOS, we can press the combination of <kbd>cmd</kbd> + <kbd>shift</kbd> + <kbd>4</kbd> keys to start capturing a screenshot.

Even though we can move the mouse to resize the captured area, the top left corner is fixed. Sometime it's not convenient if we want to adjust the top left corner.

In that case, rather than pressing the <kbd>escape</kbd> key and try again, you can hit and hold the <kbd>space</kbd> key. Moving your mouse will also move the screenshot area.
