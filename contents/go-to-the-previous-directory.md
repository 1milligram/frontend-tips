We probably know that the `cd` command can be used to go to the given directory:

```shell
$ cd /path/to/directory
```

If you work with the terminal more often, then you might need to switch back and forth between different directories. If you see that typing the full path in the `cd` command is not convenient, then you can replace the full path with `-`.

The following command will bring you to the previous working directory:

```shell
$ cd -
```
