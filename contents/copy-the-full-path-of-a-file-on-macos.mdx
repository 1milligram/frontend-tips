title: Copy the full path of a file on macOS
---

On macOS, we can copy the full path of a file by right-clicking the file, and move to the _Copy_ menu item of the context menu.
Press and hold the _Alt_ key, then the menu item's label turns to _Copy ... as Pathname_.

Clicking the menu item will save the full path to the clipboard.
