These tags are often used for styling purposes. It's recommended not to use them. Instead, use the semantic tags or CSS styles that provide the same appearances.

| Tag   | Recommended way                 |
| ----- | ------------------------------- |
| `<b>` | `<strong>`                      |
| `<i>` | `<em>`                          |
| `<s>` | `text-decoration: line-through` |
| `<u>` | `text-decoration: underline`    |
