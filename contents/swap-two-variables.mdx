title: Swap two variables
---

There are a few ways to [swap two variables](https://phuoc.ng/collection/1-loc/swap-two-variables/) without using a temporary variable:

```js
[a, b] = [b, a];

// Or
a = [b, (b = a)][0];

// Or
a = ((x) => x)(b, (b = a));
```

If both variables are numbers, then you can swap them with operators:

```js
a = b + ((b = a), 0);

// Or
a = b * ((b = a), 1);
```
