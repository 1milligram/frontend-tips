title: Quickly insert alternate characters while typing
---

Do you find yourself typing in languages that use a lot of accent marks or diacritical marks? Or maybe you need to type special characters like currency or mathematical symbols? If so, inserting alternate characters can save you a lot of time and effort.

Here's how to do it:

-   Click on the text area where you want to insert the character.
-   Press and hold down the key for the character you want to insert. For example, if you want to type 'Ã©', hold down the 'e' key.
-   After a moment, a menu will appear above the cursor with a list of alternate characters.
-   Use your mouse or trackpad to select the character you want to insert, and then release the key.
-   The alternate character will be inserted into the text area.

This technique can be especially helpful when typing in languages with a lot of accent marks or other diacritical marks. It can also be useful for typing special characters like currency symbols or mathematical symbols.

Try it out for yourself! Type one of the characters 'a', 'e', 'i', 'o' or 'u' and hold it down to see the alternate characters appear.
