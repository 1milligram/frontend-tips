title: Pass an array as function arguments
---

JavaScript has some built-in functions that accept a list of individuals arguments, but passing an array doen't work. `Math.max`, `Math.min` are some of them.

They are used to find the [biggest](https://phuoc.ng/collection/1-loc/find-the-maximum-item-of-an-array) and [smallest numbers](https://phuoc.ng/collection/1-loc/find-the-minimum-item-of-an-array) in the passed arguments, repectively.

```js
Math.max(1, 2, 3, 4); // 4

// Doesn't work because it treats the array as a single parameter
// That parameter isn't a number, so the function returns `NaN`
Math.max([1, 2, 3, 4]); // NaN
```

If we want to pass a dynamic array of numbers, then the ES6 spread operator (`...`) can help. It turns a varible to a list of individual parameters:

```js
const array = [1, 2, 3, 4];
Math.max(...array); // 4
```

JavaScript engines implemented by different browsers have the limited number of parameters. Using the `...` operator doesn't work if you have a big array. Using the `reduce` method doesn't have this problem.

```js
const max = (arr) => arr.reduce((a, b) => Math.max(a, b));
max([1, 2, 3, 4]); // 4
```
