title: Insert a link into a Markdown editor quickly
---

In order to insert a link into a Markdown editor, we often put the link right after the target text to follow the standard Markdown format:

```html
... [target text](link goes here) ...
```

The link then is attached to the target text. However, there is a quick way to do that.

1. Copy the link into the clipboard
2. Select the target text
3. Then press <kbd>command</kbd> + <kbd>V</kbd> (on macOS) or <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>V</kbd> (on other operating systems) to paste the link

I see these steps work for the most popular Markdown editors such as GitHub, Slack, etc.
