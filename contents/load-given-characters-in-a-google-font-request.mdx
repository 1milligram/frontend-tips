title: Load given characters in a Google font request
---

By default, [Google font](https://fonts.google.com) loads the completed font that contains the full set of characters it supports.

There are associations that we only use a Google font for a logo or heading which has specific letters. Instead of downloading the entire font, we can ask Google for downloading a part of it that contains required characters.

We can pass the characters to the `text` parameter:

```html
<link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css2?family=Sacramento&text=MyHeading" rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" />
```

If you want to have Unicode characters, then encode them with their UTF-8 representations. For example `tips & tricks` are represented as `tips+%26+tricks`.

Reducing the size of the font file improves the loading time, especially on devices where the network speed is usually limited.
