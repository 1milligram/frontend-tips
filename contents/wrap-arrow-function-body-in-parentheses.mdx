title: Wrap arrow function body in parentheses
updated: '2023-03-28'
---

If the inline arrow function consists of the `<`, `<=`, `>` or `>=` operator, it is advised to wrap the function body in parentheses.

Looking at the two versions below, it is easy for the first variant to cause a misleading.

```js
// Bad
const compareToZero = (a) => a <= 0 ? 0 : a;

// Good
const compareToZero = (a) => (a <= 0 ? 0 : a);
```
