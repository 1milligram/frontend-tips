title: Replace multiple if statements with a single switch statement
---

We demonstrate the trick with a simple issue: Determine the quarter of a given date.
Since the month in JavaScript is zero-based, the month of a given `date` can be determined as

```js
// `date` is the input date
const month = date.getMonth() + 1;
```

The quarter is calculated based on the range of month:

```js
let quarter = 1;
if (month <= 3) {
    quarter = 1;
} else if (month <= 6) {
    quarter = 2;
} else if (month <= 9) {
    quarter = 3;
} else {
    quarter = 4;
}
```

It is not easy for us to scan multiple `if` statements above. We can make it more readable with a single `switch (true)` statement:

```js
switch (true) {
    case month <= 3:
        quarter = 1;
        break;
    case month <= 6:
        quarter = 2;
        break;
    case month <= 9:
        quarter = 3;
        break;
    default:
        quarter = 4;
        break;
}
```

> This trick gives us an idea of using `switch (true)` to make the code more readable. The specific issue in this post, calculating the [quarter of a given date](https://phuoc.ng/collection/1-loc/get-the-current-quarter-of-a-date/), can be done with a [single line-of-code](https://phuoc.ng/collection/1-loc).
