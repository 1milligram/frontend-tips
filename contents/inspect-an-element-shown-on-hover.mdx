title: Inspect an element shown on hover
---

To inspect an element with Chrome DevTools, we usually right-click the element and choose _Inspect_ from the context menu.
However, it doesn't work with a dynamic element that is displayed when we hover on a given element. A JavaScript tooltip is a common example.

There are a few ways to inspect that kind of elements.

## Trigger the mouseover event

-   Right-click the original element, and choose the _Inspect_ menu item
-   Click the _Console_ tab
-   Fire the `mouseover` event by excuting the following code in the _Console_:

```js
$0.dispatchEvent(
    new MouseEvent('mouseover', {
        view: window,
        bubbles: true,
        cancelable: true,
    })
);
```

> `$0` represents the current inspected element

It simulates the `mouseover` event that is supposed to happen when we hover on the original element.

## Pause the script execution

-   Open the _Chrome Developer Tools_, and click the _Sources_ tab
-   Hover on the target element, and click the _F8_ key
-   Move the mouse over the target element
-   Activate the _Elements_ tab, and you will see the dynamic element shown up here

## Use debugger

It's similar to the previous way.

-   In the _Console_, execute the following code:

```js
handler = (e) => {
    if (e.key === 'Enter') debugger;
};
document.addEventListener('keydown', handler);
```

Running `debugger` here will pause the script execution when we press the _Enter_ key. Of course, you can replace it with other key.

-   Hover on the target element, and click the _Enter_ key
-   The dynamic element is displayed and visible under the _Elements_ tab

Once you don't want to monitor the dynamic element anymore, you can [stop listening](https://phuoc.ng/collection/html-dom/attach-or-detach-an-event-handler/) to the `keydown` event:

```js
document.removeEventListener('keydown', handler);
```

## Track subtree modifications

-   Open the _Chrome Developer Tools_, and click the _Elements_ tab
-   Right-click the `body` element, and choose _Break on > subtree modifications_ from the context menu

> If the dynamic element, a tooltip for example, is generated in the parent element of the target element, then you should choose the parent instead of the `body` element

-   Move the mouse over the target element
-   You will see the dynamic element shown in the _Elements_ tab
