title: Ignore items from array destructuring
---

When destructuring an array, you can skip certain items by using blanks:

```js
const dateTime = '2021-02-28T14:57:00';

// Ignore the date part
const [, time] = dateTime.split('T');

// Ignore the seconds
const [hours, minutes] = time.split(':');

hours; // '14'
minutes; // '57'
```

If you are working in a team, then it's a good idea to add comments for skipped items. It also makes the code more readable:

```js
const [
    ,
    // date
    time,
] = dateTime.split('T');

const [hours, minutes /* seconds */] = time.split(':');
```
