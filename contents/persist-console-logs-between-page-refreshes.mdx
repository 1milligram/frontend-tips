title: Persist Console logs between page refreshes
---

Imagine a situation where you print something in the _Console_ when clicking or following a link. When you navigate to another page, the _Console_ is cleared and all the messages are lost.

Fortunately, both Chrome DevTools and Firefox Developer Tools give us options to persist the logs between page loads.

Under the _Console_ panel of Chrome DevTools, click the cog icon on the right, and turn on the _Preserve log_ option:

In addition to the logs of each page, DevTools also lets you know when you navigate to another page. It's easy for us to determine where a log message comes from.
