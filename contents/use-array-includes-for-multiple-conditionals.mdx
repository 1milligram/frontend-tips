title: 'Use Array.includes for multiple conditionals'
---

Let's consider a function that determines the total [number of days](https://phuoc.ng/collection/1-loc/get-the-number-of-days-in-given-month) in a given month.

```js
const getDays = (month, year) => {
  ...
};
```

Since months in JavaScripts start from 0, we assume that the `month` parameter is zero-based index. We can make the function [quickly return](https://phuoc.ng/collection/tips/early-return) if the month is April, June, September or November:

```js
if (month === 3 || month === 5 || month === 8 || month === 10) {
  return 30;
}
...
```

These conditionals can be replaced with a single check by using the `Array.includes` function:

```js
if ([3, 5, 8, 10].includes(month)) {
  return 30;
}
...
```

For this specific function, we also can use a [lookup table](https://phuoc.ng/collection/tips/replace-multiple-if-statements-with-a-lookup-table):

```js
const isLeapYear = (year) => year % 4 === 0 && (year % 100 !== 0 || year % 400 === 0);

const getDays = (month, year) => [31, isLeapYear(year) ? 29 : 28, 31, 30, 31, 30, 31, 31, 30, 31, 30, 31][month];
```
