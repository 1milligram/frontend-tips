title: Get the current timestamp
---

There are a few ways to get the current timestamp. All method return the number of milliseconds:

```js
new Date().getTime();

Date.now();

// These method are the same
// The unary operator (`+`) calls the `valueOf` method automatically
+new Date();
new Date().valueOf();
```
