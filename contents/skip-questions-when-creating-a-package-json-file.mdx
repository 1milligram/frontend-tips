title: 'Skip questions when creating a package.json file'
---

We often use the `npm init` command to initialize a `package.json` file. The command will ask you some questions that are used to fill the content of `package.json` later.

```shell
$ npm init
package name: (dev)
version: (1.0.0)
...
```

If you're a lazy at this step and would like to manually edit the file, you can skip all questions by using the `y` parameter:

```shell
$ npm init -y

// Or
$ npm init --yes
```

Then it will create a `package.json` file with the default value for basic options as following:

```json
{
    "name": "dev",
    "version": "1.0.0",
    "description": "",
    "main": "index.js",
    "scripts": {
        "test": "echo \"Error: no test specified\" && exit 1"
    },
    "keywords": [],
    "author": "",
    "license": "ISC"
}
```
