title: Create a multiline strings
---

To create a multiline strings, the most common way is to concatenate them as shown below:

```js
const multilineStrings = 'This is a\n' + 'multiline\n' + 'strings';
```

Joining an array of strings is another approach:

```js
const multilineStrings = ['This is a', 'multiline', 'strings'].join('\n');
```

ES6 introduces an easier way to do that. It uses the template literal which is delimited by backticks:

```js
const multilineStrings = `This is a
multiline
strings`;
```
