title: Validate an input value with the pattern attribute
---

Validating user input against specific rules is a common thing when we work with input fields. Without using an external [validation library](https://formvalidation.io), we can use some built-in HTML 5 inputs to strict the value.

Specifically, the following input types force user to enter valid characters:

| Input type      | Description                                                                                    |
| --------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `type="color"`  | Only accepts a [color](https://formvalidation.io/guide/validators/color)                       |
| `type="date"`   | Only accepts a [date](https://formvalidation.io/guide/validators/date)                         |
| `type="email"`  | Only accepts a valid [email address](https://formvalidation.io/guide/validators/email-address) |
| `type="number"` | Only accepts a [number](https://formvalidation.io/guide/validators/integer)                    |
| `type="tel"`    | Only accepts a [phone number](https://formvalidation.io/guide/validators/phone)                |
| `type="url"`    | Only accepts a [URL](https://formvalidation.io/guide/validators/uri)                           |

Although these input types are useful, they can't serve the cases that the input must match a given regular expression.

For example, how we can force user to enter exactly 10 digits of a phone number when using the `type="tel"` attribute. That's where the `pattern` attribute comes in.

The sample code below solves the issue mentioned earlier:

```html
<input type="tel" pattern="^\d{10}$" title="Please enter 10 digits" />
```

It's recommended to use the `title` attribute, so users know what the correct value is.
